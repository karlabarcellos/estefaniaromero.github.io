I am an economist with extensive experience leading research, statistical and econometric analysis on macroeconomics and social issues. I hold a bachelor's degree in economics and a masterâ€™s degree in public administration.

I use data-driven frameworks to evaluate public policies and economic development strategies. Currently, I am researching the future of work and education in Canada.

Additionally, I love learning. I am constantly attending boot camps, reading, and writing about economics, data, new software, and technologies.
